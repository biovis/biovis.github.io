# BioVis Main Page & Archive  

This repository has two functions: 

 * being the main entry point to the top-level biovis site and doing a redirect to the current year's version. 
 * hosting the archive of BioVis 2011-2016 websites. 
 
 ## Redirecting

From 2017 onwards, new versions of the website are hosted in separate repositories on https://github.com/biovis/

The [index.html](https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/blob/master/index.html) file in this repository chooses the redirect target. To update to a new year, simply change all instances of the old year to the new year. 

## Archive 

Old versions of the biovis website are hosted here. Some of these (2012-2015) are scrapes of a drupal CMS. In 2016, we used jekyll but a manual build process. This is replaced by the explicit repositories starting with [2017](https://github.com/biovis/2017). 

 * 2011 (hand-written): 
https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/tree/master/2011
 * 2012-2015 (the drupal years):
https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/tree/master/year
 * 2016 (the beginning of Jekyll): 
https://github.com/biovis/biovis.github.io/tree/master/2016
