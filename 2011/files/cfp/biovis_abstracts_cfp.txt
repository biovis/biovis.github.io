BioVis 2011: IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization

at VisWeek 2011 in Providence, RI
October 23-24, 2011

Website: http://www.biovis.net

Abstract Submission Deadline: July 8, 2011


*** 1. Aims and Scope ***

The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for
computational visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain
insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The goal of the first IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization
(BioVis 2011) is to create the premier international and
interdisciplinary event for all aspects of visualization in biology.
This symposium will bring together researchers from the visualization,
bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating,
inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in biological data
visualization, as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in
state-of-the-art visualization research. As the first annual BioVis
Symposium, this event seeks to emphasize inclusion and interaction
between these communities as its primary impact.

The symposium will serve as a platform for researchers from these
fields to increase the impact of visualization approaches in biology.
The breadth and diversity of biological research areas will enable
researchers from all parts of the visualization community to
contribute to this effort, and the symposium will provide an excellent
opportunity to initiate interdisciplinary collaborations. Finally, it
will provide an outlet and training ground for young and freshly
minted visualization researchers with a keen interest in problems of
biology and provide a venue for researchers in biology and
bioinformatics to share pressing visualization challenges and
potential solutions in their fields.


*** 2. Topics ***

We are looking for contributions on all aspects of visualization in
biology. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

- Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
- Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
- Phylogenetic data
- Ecological and taxonomic data
- Biological networks and pathways
- Biological ontologies
- Molecular structures (protein structures, RNA structures, etc.)
- Subcellular, cellular, tissue- and organ-level structures
- Visualization of image data, such as microscopic or radiological data
- Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
- Modeling, simulation and visualization of biological systems
- Visualization in neurobiology and developmental biology
- Systems and software frameworks for biological visualization
- Integration of visualization in biological workflows or collaborative processes
- Visualization and visual analytics of integrated data sets
- Evaluation of biological visualization systems including interfaces,
  usability, laboratory experiments, and field studies   
- Creation and visualization of biological atlases and metadata
- Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization


*** 3. Abstract Criteria ***

Given the goal of bringing together members of both the biology and
visualization communities for discussion, the symposium solicitation
is purposefully broad and open-minded to diverse types of submissions. 
The abstracts are meant to support an exchange of ideas and can be based on
work in progress. Each abstract will be 
reviewed by the Program Committee. Types of submissions 
include, but are not limited to:

- Descriptions of work in progress and preliminary results
- Demonstrations of new or recent systems, both open source and proprietary
- Descriptions of analysis challenges where current tools fall short
  for specific datasets and goals, to inform the visualization
  community in producing better future solutions 
- Ideas for future research directions
- Experience reports, highlighting lessons learned from the deployment
  of relevant previously published work 
- Reports of original research

Abstracts may be up to 2 pages. Accepted abstracts will be presented
as posters, interactive demos or videos at the symposium -- authors
will be asked to specify the mode of presentation at the time of
submission. All presenters will have the opportunity to give a brief
overview of their work in a plenary "fast-forward
session". Additionally, presenters of selected abstracts will be given
the opportunity for longer oral presentation at the symposium.

All abstracts will be considered a "personal communication" to the
symposium attendees.  Abstracts will not be published in the
proceedings, but will appear in the program, with the distributed
symposium materials, and on the symposium website.



*** 4. Important Dates ***

Abstract submission: Friday, July 8, 2011
Notification of acceptance of abstracts: August 15, 2011

Camera ready copy: Wednesday, August 31, 2011

All deadlines are at 5:00 pm Pacific Time (PDT).
